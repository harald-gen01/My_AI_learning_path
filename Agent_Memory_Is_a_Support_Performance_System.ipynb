        "## TL;DR (What this Colab demonstrates)\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates **agent memory as an operational performance lever** in customer support.\n",
        "\n",
        "It runs the same “reopened ticket” scenario in two modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Without Memory (stateless agent)**\n",
        "   The agent treats the reopened issue as new, repeats discovery (asks for logs again), and follows generic troubleshooting steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **With Memory (stateful agent)**\n",
        "   The agent retrieves relevant prior ticket “memory notes” (customer + issue type), reuses what was already tried, asks only **what changed**, and escalates with a complete context package when recurrence rules are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What’s inside (plain English)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Procedural memory** = an approved support playbook (SOP steps + escalation rule)\n",
        "* **Episodic memory** = prior ticket notes (summary, actions taken, outcome, constraints)\n",
        "* **Retrieval** = memory notes are embedded and recalled via similarity search\n",
        "* **Retention (TTL)** = memory expires after **N minutes** to simulate governance/forgetting\n",
        "* **LLM generation (OpenAI)** = the LLM only **composes** the customer-facing message using retrieved context (it does not “know” anything magically)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## The point of the demo\n",
        "\n",
        "It shows that **continuity changes behavior**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* fewer redundant questions (less rediscovery)\n",
        "* faster path to next best action\n",
        "* more consistent escalation decisions\n",
        "* better handoff packages (when escalation happens)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## KPI proxy output (what you should look at)\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook prints a tiny KPI delta table comparing:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **# Questions asked** (proxy for customer back-and-forth cycles)\n",
        "* **# Steps recommended** (proxy for operational effort / repeated work)\n",
        "* **Repeated discovery flag** (did the agent re-ask what it already knew?)\n",
        "\n",
        "It also shows how overly aggressive retention (TTL too short) causes the agent to revert to rediscovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What “faster” means here (important)\n",
        "\n",
        "This demo is **not** measuring model latency (milliseconds). “With memory” can be slower per request because it performs retrieval and writes a higher-quality response.\n",
        "The KPIs are **operational speed proxies**: fewer redundant questions and repeated steps → fewer back-and-forth cycles, fewer reopens/escalations, and faster **end-to-end** time-to-resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to read the results\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TTL = 20 minutes** → memory survives → continuity preserved → less rediscovery\n",
        "* **TTL = 5 minutes** → memory expires → agent reverts to rediscovery → KPI benefit disappears\n",
        "\n",
        "**Executive takeaway:** Memory improves support performance, but only if retention and governance are designed intentionally.\n"
